Exercises for Chapter 8

Do each of the end-of-chapter exercises for Chapter 8.
If you used Visual Studio, upload the entire solution folder.

If you used IDLE, just upload the .py files


1. Improve the Critter Caretaker program by allowing the user to
specify how much food he or she feeds the critter and how long
he or she plays with the critter. Have these values affect how
quickly the critter’s hunger and boredom levels drop.
2. Write a program that simulates a television by creating it as an
object. The user should be able to enter a channel number and
raise or lower the volume. Make sure that the channel number
and volume level stay within valid ranges.
3. Create a “back door” in the Critter Caretaker program that
shows the exact values of the object’s attributes. Accomplish
this by printing the object when a secret selection, not listed
in the menu, is entered as the user’s choice. (Hint: add the
special method __str__() to the Critter class.)
4. Create a Critter Farm program by instantiating several
Critter objects and keeping track of them through a list. Mimic
the Critter Caretaker program, but instead of requiring the
user to care for a single critter, require them to care for an
entire farm. Each menu choice should allow the user to
perform some action for all of the critters (feed all of the
critters, play with all of the critters, or listen to all of the
critters). To make the program interesting, give each critter
random starting hunger and boredom levels.
